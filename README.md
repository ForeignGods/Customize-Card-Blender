# Customize-Card-Blender

I wrote this add-on to make the process of customizing the audio visualizing cards in my blender project more time efficient.
<br />Without this you would have to set up all the changes for a new card in blender manually.
<br />The script generates a panel with predefined options so that you can customize cards without having to know how to use blender.

Supported Blender versions 3.1 (Script File - CustomizeCard.py)

## Functionality

![Panel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78089013/162726951-a7c7ca47-7693-4005-a937-3ae2ce5fba58.png)

**Bake Sound**

Opens file browser so that you can select .mp3 files to use for baking sounds to f-curves.

**Set Song Title** 

Creates new folder when setting the song title with the same name as the song and uses it as render filepath.

**Set Duration**

By giving the time in minutes and seconds as an input the animation of the counter and the slider on the bottom of the card will be generated through the scripted geometry node values. 
<br />Additionally the frame range that should be rendered is set. 

**Change Background Texture**

With a dropdown you're able to select the background of the card from 9 diffrent options.

**Change Shape**

With a dropdown you're able to select a 3d shape (top-left corner) from 5 possible options.

**Change Sculpture**

With a dropdown you're able to select a sculpture from 8 possible options.



## Demo
Below you can see some demo-files I created with this script. 
<br />I had to reduce the file size to less than 10mb to be able to upload them here (that's why the quality is not optimal).
